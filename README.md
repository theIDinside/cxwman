# CXWindowManager



## Todo's
1. Setup specific key & key combos for window manager actions such as:
   - [x] Rotate window left/right
   - [ ] Teleport window to ...
   - [ ] Kill client & application
   - [ ] Custom configuration
   - [ ] Resize window
  
2. Grab WM Hints and WM atoms etc. Can we get client names, so we can use them as identifiers?
